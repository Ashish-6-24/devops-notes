### ☁️ GitHub & Remote Repository

| # | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 26 | `git remote -v` | Shows the remote repositories connected to the local repository. |
| 27 | `git remote add origin <github-repo-url>` | Connects the local repository to a GitHub remote named `origin`. |

| 30 | `git push -u origin feature-1` | Pushes the `feature-1` branch to GitHub and sets its upstream tracking branch. |

---

### 🔗 `origin` vs `upstream`

**`origin`** → Usually points to my own GitHub repository or personal fork, where I have read and write access.

**`upstream`** → Usually points to the original repository, which I use to get the latest changes and keep my fork updated.

```text
upstream → Original Repository
                ↓
              Fork
                ↓
origin → My GitHub Repository
```

| # | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 31 | `git remote add upstream <original-repo-url>` | Adds the original repository as a remote named `upstream`. |
| 32 | `git fetch upstream` | Downloads the latest changes and branch information from the original repository. |
| 33 | `git merge upstream/main` | Merges the latest `main` changes from `upstream` into the current branch. |

---

### 🔄 Fetch & Pull

| # | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 34 | `git fetch origin` | Downloads changes from the remote without merging them into the current branch. |
| 35 | `git pull origin main` | Downloads changes from GitHub and integrates them into the current branch. |

---

### 📦 Clone

| # | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 36 | `git clone <repository-url>` | Copies a remote repository from GitHub to the local machine. |

> 💡 **Fork** is a GitHub feature, not a Git command. It creates your own copy of another repository on GitHub.

# 📌 Day 24 – Advanced Git: Merge, Rebase, Stash & Cherry-Pick

## 🔀 Merge

| # | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 37 | `git merge <branch>` | Merges the specified branch into the branch I am currently on. |
| 38 | `git merge --squash <branch>` | Combines the changes from the feature branch into the current branch without creating the source branch's individual commits; I create the final commit separately. |

---

## ⚠️ Merge Conflict Resolution

| # | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 39 | `git merge <branch>` | Starts the merge and may stop when Git finds conflicting changes. |
| 40 | `git add <filename>` | Marks a manually resolved conflicted file as resolved. |
| 41 | `git commit -m "<message>"` | Completes the merge after all conflicts have been resolved and staged. |

---

## 🧭 Rebase

| # | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 42 | `git rebase <branch>` | Replays the current branch's commits on top of the specified branch. |


## 🧹 Squash Merge

| # | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 43 | `git merge --squash <branch>` | Collects all changes from the feature branch into the working tree/staging area without creating the final commit automatically. |
| 44 | `git commit -m "<message>"` | Creates the single final commit after a squash merge. |


## 📦 Git Stash

| # | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 45 | `git stash push -m "<message>"` | Temporarily saves tracked uncommitted changes and labels the stash with a message. |
| 46 | `git stash list` | Lists all saved stash entries. |
| 47 | `git stash pop` | Restores the latest stash and normally removes that stash entry after successful application. |
| 48 | `git stash apply stash@{N}` | Restores a specific stash while keeping that stash entry in the stash list. |


### 🧠 `pop` vs `apply`

| Command | Restores changes | Keeps stash entry |
|---|---:|---:|
| `git stash pop` | ✅ | ❌ Normally removed after success |
| `git stash apply stash@{N}` | ✅ | ✅ |

> 💡 The stash numbering starts at `0`, so `stash@{0}` is normally the newest entry.

---

## 🍒 Cherry-Pick

| # | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 49 | `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>` | Applies the changes introduced by one specific commit to the current branch as a new commit. |

# 📌 Day 25 – Git Reset & Revert

## 🔄 Git Reset

| # | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 50 | `git reset --soft HEAD~1` | Moves `HEAD` back one commit and keeps the changes **staged**. |
| 51 | `git reset --mixed HEAD~1` | Moves `HEAD` back one commit and keeps the changes **unstaged**. |
| 52 | `git reset --hard HEAD~1` | Moves `HEAD` back one commit and resets the staging area and working files. |
| 53 | `git reflog` | Shows recent `HEAD` movements and helps find commits after a reset. |

> ⚠️ `git reset --hard` can permanently remove uncommitted work. Use it carefully.

---

## ↩️ Git Revert

| # | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 54 | `git revert <commit-hash>` | Creates a new commit that undoes the changes from an earlier commit. |
| 55 | `git revert --continue` | Continues the revert after a conflict is resolved. |
| 56 | `git revert --abort` | Cancels the revert and returns to the state before the revert started. |

> 💡 Easy rule: **Reset for local history. Revert for shared/pushed history.**
